# <Hire-Me-Hub>

## Description
In this project, I wanted to build a portfolio from scratch to test my skills. It was created in VScode and depolyed through Github. The code language we used were HTML, CSS, and IMG. Building this portfolio really challenged my little knowlege of coding, while building this it was brought to my attention that I still have more to learn about code. The biggest challenged was CSS, I was having a hard time with the property and connecting them to HTML. With this project, I want to show my skills and work to other hires and employees.
